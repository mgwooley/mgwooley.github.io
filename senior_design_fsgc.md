## FSGC Hybrid Rocket "Gold" Senior Design Team

### Project Description 
During the final semesters of the Aerospace Engineering program at UCF, every student is required to participate in Senior Design for two semesters. The team that I was paired with collectively chose to particiipate in the Florida Space Grant Consortium Hybrid Rocket Competition. While the competition never materialized due to COVID-19, the team was able to develop a mature vehicle design, as well as complete static fire engine testing. My specific contributions were a mix of several roles including but not limited to defining requirements based on customer requests, CAD design utilizing said requirements, and basic CFD analysis in order to characterize coefficients of drag. In addition to these technical roles, I was selected to be the "team lead" which involved my being the primary liason between the team and our advisor Kyle Davidson.

### CAD

For the FSGC Hybrid Rocket system, I was tasked with developing a full engine system CAD. This is comprised of a custom retainer design, bulkheads, and nozzle geometry.
