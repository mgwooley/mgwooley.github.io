### Description
As an Aerospace Engineering student, I have participated in a number of projects, and leadership roles. From designing microgravity experiments, to acting as the President of a student organization, I have made efforts to expand my skills not only as an engineer, but a teammate as well. Shown below are a selection of projects I have participated in.
