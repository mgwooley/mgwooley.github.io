### Description
As an Aerospace Engineering graduate from the University of Central Florida, I have developed my skills as an engineer as well as a teammate. I look forward to applying the leadership experience I gained through my role as President of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space and participating in a number of projects, including microgravity experiment design, hybrid rocket design, as well as a number of others as outlined in the work examples below.
